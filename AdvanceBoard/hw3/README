technologies:
1. We use php to do the server side programming, with a combination of javascript
at the client side. We put authentication and database functions in the 
server side, and we put other trivial functions at the client side using
javascript. We do non-significant form checks using javascript, and do check on
 important parts on the server side. 

2. When sending requsets, we use ajax to capture the http response and
alert user with corresponding error messages.

3. We put log in information of the database in an seperate file and only allow the
server to access it to improve security. 

4. We also use a salt and md5 to encode user password before storing it into the database. 
And when implementing the authentication system, we use session to do state management.

5. In terms of database, we use mysql. We store user information, soundboard information in
the database. Also there is a log system which records the total access of each
soundboard, each sound, and the user logging attempts in the database. 

6. there is an admin account that can edit the public soundboards.
